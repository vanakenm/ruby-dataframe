# Steps

## Raw

lab1 + lab2 + plot or predict or both
What make special? Vectors + defaults data sets + Libs!
Data frame example
Compare with ruby code
but... possible with Ruby code?

Looks at the API

## R example

### Basics & vectors
### Data Frame from fixed data
### Static Data Frame (cars)
### Basics (rows/headers)
### Group
### Predict
### Plot 

- basic on cars
- ggplot on mtcars (+ install packages)

## Summary

-> we have libs, a way to install them and a central server to host them.
-> a REPL, but can also run scripts (obviously)
-> even a web frameowrk

## Ruby

### I would love a data frame in Ruby

- This is clearly possible
- This means creating a gem

## TDD style

What's TDD?

### Steps

- New empty data frame should have 0 rows -> Just the class
- Create with hash should have X rows & columns
- Create from CSV
- Group? Check API
